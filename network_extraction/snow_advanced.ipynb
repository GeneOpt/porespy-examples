    "The SNOW algorithm, [published in Physical Review E](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.96.023307), uses a marker-based watershed segmentation algorithm to partition an image into regions belonging to each pore.  The main contribution of the SNOW algorithm is to find a suitable set of initial markers in the image so that the watershed is not over-segmented.  SNOW is an acronym for Sub-Network of an Over-segmented Watershed.  PoreSpy includes a predefined function called ``snow`` that applies all the steps automatically, but this example will illustrate the individual steps explicitly on a 3D image."

This step is the slowest part of the process by far, but could be sped up if a faster implementation of ``watershed`` is used.  The 300**3 image used in this example will take about 1 minute to complete."
